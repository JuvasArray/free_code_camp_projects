            <p class="legend">Abane Ramdane was an Algerian political activist and revolutionary born in Kabylia. He played a key
                role in the organization of the independence struggle during the Algerian war. His influence was so
                great that he was known as "the architect of the revolution".

                    - The National Liberation Front (FLN) had killed him, supposedly for creating a cult of the
                    individual rather than the collective leadership. He was "super-political" and his murder was
                    disturbing to many FLN members including President Boumédiène who, according to the book, A Savage
                    War of Peace, kept the assassins out of his future Algerian government..
